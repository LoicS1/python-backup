# 6a. Prediction: The output code will say true beause both parts of the statement are true. a squared is nine and a is not greater, but equal to, 3
a**2 >= 9 and not a>3
#[Out]# True
# prediction was correct
# 6b. Prediction: the code will come out as true because the first part of the statement is true, but the second is not. Since it is an or statement, only one of the two statements needs to be true for the output code to say true
a+2 == 5 or a-1 != 3
